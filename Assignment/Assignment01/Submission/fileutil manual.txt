HOW TO COMPILE
	Place 29801036_fileutil.c, 29801036_file_manipulations.c, 29801036_fileutil.h, 29801036_file_manipulations.h and makefile
	under the same directory and perform the command "make -f makefile" in the terminal under the same directory.

NAME
	./fileutil - file utility

SYNOPSIS
	./fileutil [OPTION]
	./fileutil -d [destdir] [OPTION] ...
	./fileutil -n [numlines] [OPTION]...
	./fileutil -L [tail] [OPTION] ...
	./fileutil [sourcefile]	[OPTION] ...
	
DESCRIPTION
	./fileutil copies content from sourcefile specified in the source path to the specified destination directory. Content of 
	the file is copied from the beginning of the file by default. If no destination directory (-d) is specified, the file 
	content will be displayed to the terminal (stdout).

	sourcefile
			This argument if specified must be input as the first argument.

	-d, -- destdir
			destination directory for the sourcefile to be copied/displayed to. If this option is not used, file will be 
			displayed to the terminal (stdout) by default. Allows the user to input a path for the source file to display/copy.
			sourcefile must appear immediately after the command (e.g., ./fileutil sourcefile).

	-n, -- numlines
			number of lines to be copied/displayed to 

	-L, -- tail
			Makes program to switch to Tail mode where the View/Copy should be performed on the last 10 (or n) lines.

EXAMPLES
		./fileutil
		Displays the first 10 lines of the sample.txt file from the current directory

		./fileutil -n 20
		Displays the first 20 lines of the sample.txt file from the current directory

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -n 20
		Displays the first 20 lines of the a.txt file

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2/
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the first 10 lines

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2/ -n 15
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the first 15 lines

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2 -n 15 -L
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the last 15 lines

		./fileutil -d /home/student/dir2
		Copy the first 10 lines of sample.txt from the current directory to dir2

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2 -L
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the last 10 lines

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -L -n 15 -d /home/student/dir2/
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the last 15 lines

		./fileutil /home/student/dir1/a.txt -d /home/student/dir2/ -n 15 -L
		Copy a.txt to dir2 where the newly created a.txt only contains the last 15 lines

OVERVIEW
	option can be given in any order and sourcefile is optional. A "sample.txt"" file must be placed in the same directory as fileutil.
	Any non option arguments will be ignored besides sourcefile. If sourcefile is not specified, sample.txt will be used as the sourcefile.

EXIT status:
	0		if OK,
	
	1		if minor problems (e.g., error in opening readonly file, destination directory provided is
			not absolute).

	2		if serious trouble (e.g., error in opening/creating write file, file with the same filename
			already exists at destination directory or destination directory does not exist).
